# binomial-pricing


This project provides an implementation of the Binomial Option Pricing Model in C. The Binomial Option Pricing Model is a widely used mathematical model for calculating the theoretical price of options, both European and American. This model is based on the idea of constructing a binomial tree of possible future asset prices and recursively calculating option prices at each node of the tree.

This project specifically focuses on calculating the prices of American options by taking into account factors like the underlying price, strike price, risk-free interest rate, volatility, and time to expiration.
